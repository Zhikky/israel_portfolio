            In creating a solution, it’s best to start from solving one problem
            first. From solving that problem well enough, you can begin to
            expand on that you have and solve more problems.

          <li className=" font-geist text-white text-base leading-[25px]">
            In determining your target location, also try to be specific. Fact
            is you can’t cater for the entire population/populace. However, if
            you can decide what percentage of the population have a certain
            need, confirm that it is an actual need and solve it well enough,
            you’ll be doing a good job. What we could have done from the
            ground-up instead was to decide what exact problem we wanted to
            solve and not try to perform an overhaul of the educational system.
            We should have also decided who our target market was and provide
            our solution to be better suited for them.

            You don’t know what you don’t know. As simple as this sounds,
            reality is you can never be really sure what the problem is until
            you are able to prove from your user research that there is an
            actual problem. Doesn’t even matter if you’ve been a part of that
            target market before. Remember, you are designing for users and not
            for yourself
