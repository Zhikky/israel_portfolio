            Fundamentally, all academic institutions perform almost the same
            operation but there are some activities that some do and others do
            not and vice versa.

            Even though administrators have roles clearly distinct from academic
            or non-academic staff, some staff members still have administrative
            roles.

            Class notes really don’t change; they’re really just improved upon
            so there should be a means of picking up notes from when they were
            last updated and updating them.

            Within a geographical location (e.g. a country), virtually every
            academic institution uses the same curriculum so there could be
            overall class notes that schools could pick from and then tailor to
            meet specific academic needs.

            In this age of online courses, students prefer having access to a
            myriad of academic opportunities rather than the streamline
            traditional academic system e.g. running two programs in two
            different institutions.

            Grading criterion varies from school to school so customisation
            should be catered for Etc.
