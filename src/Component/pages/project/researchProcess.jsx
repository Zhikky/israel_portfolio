              The design sprint started with itemising the stakeholder we were
              designing solutions for and then moving on to begin qualitative
              interviews with them. We decided that we were going to design for
              the:

              Our primary means of recruitment for the study was to reach out to
              members of any of these stakeholder groups that we could find in
              our locality (a mistake that we subsequently learnt not to make
              anymore as this wouldnâ€™t reflect the heterogeneity of educational
              systems across different localities and nationalities).

            <p className=" font-geist text-white text-sm w-full text-justify">
              We majorly had extensive period of user interviews with the
              respondents and got quite some insight into how the educational
              system primarily in Nigeria across all strata of education works.
              So research was purely quantitative after which we had affinity
              maps taken and were able to narrow down to some specific areas of
              interest.
